# ActivityRecognition-EVE

This repository contains the code and documentation for my project on activity recognition using the EVE (Enhanced Video Experience) dataset. 
The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately recognize and classify human activities from video data.

In this project, I focus on the task of activity recognition using the EVE dataset. Activity recognition plays a crucial role in various domains, including video surveillance, healthcare, and human-computer interaction. 
The EVE dataset provides a diverse set of video clips capturing different activities, such as reading text, watching images and watching videos, making it an excellent resource for training and evaluating activity recognition models.

# Dataset

The EVE dataset is a curated collection of video clips, each labeled with corresponding activity categories. For downloading the dataset follow the instruction on the dataset official website https://github.com/swook/EVE/blob/master/DATASET.md
